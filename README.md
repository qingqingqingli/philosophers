# philosophers

***This project focuses on the basics of threading a process and how to work on the same memory space. You will learn how to make threads, and discover the mutex, semaphore and shared memory.***

## Project requirements

- A number of philosophers are sitting at a round table doing one of three things: eating, thinking or sleeping. 
  
- The philosophers sit at a circular table with a large bowl of spaghetti in the center. There are some forks on the table. As spaghetti is difficult to serve and eat with a single fork, it is assumed that a philosopher must eat with two forks, one for each hand.

- The philosophers must never be starving. Every philosopher needs to eat. Philosophers don’t speak with each other. Philosophers don’t know when another philosopher is about to die. 

- Each time a philosopher has finished eating, he will drop his forks and start sleeping. When a philosopher is done sleeping, he will start thinking. The simulation stops when a philosopher dies.
